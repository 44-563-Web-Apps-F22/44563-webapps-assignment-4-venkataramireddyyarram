   <h5> WILFRED </h5>  <br>
   <p>[sighing] Ah, Master Point!</p>

 <h5 class="POINT">POINT</h5>    <br> <p class="direction"> [changing his manner] Ha! friend jailer! Jailer that
            wast— jailer that never shalt be more! Jailer that
            jailed not, or that jailed, if jail he did, so
            unjailery that 'twas but jerry-jailing, or jailing in
            joke— though no joke to him who, by unjailerlike
            jailing, did so jeopardise his jailership. Come, take
            heart, smile, laugh, wink, twinkle, thou tormentor
            that tormentest none— thou racker that rackest not—
            thou pincher out of place— come, take heart, and be
            merry, as I am!— [aside, dolefully]— as I am!</p>

  <h5 class="WILFRED">WILFRED</h5> <br> <p class="speech"> Aye, it's well for thee to laugh. Thou hast a good
            post, and hast cause to be merry.</p>

  <h5 class="POINT">POINT</h5>  <br>  <p class="direction"> [bitterly] Cause? Have we not all cause? Is not the
            world a big butt of humour, into which all who will
            may drive a gimlet? See, I am a salaried wit; and is
            there aught in nature more ridiculous? A poor, dull,
            heart-broken man, who must needs be merry, or he will
            be whipped; who must rejoice, lest he starve; who must
            jest you, jibe you, quip you, crank you, wrack you,
            riddle you, from hour to hour, from day to day, from
            year to year, lest he dwindle, perish, starve,
            pine,and die! Why, when there's naught else to laugh
            at, I laugh at myself till I ache for it!</p>

  <h5 class="WILFRED">WILFRED</h5>  <br> <p class="speech">Yet I have often thought that a jester's calling would
            suit me to a hair.</p>

  <h5 class="POINT">POINT</h5>  <br>   <p class="speech">Thee? Would suit thee, thou death's head and cross-
            bones?</p>

  <h5 class="WILFRED">WILFRED</h5> <br> <p class="speech"> Aye, I have a pretty wit— a light, airy, joysome wit,
            spiced with anecdotes of prison cells and the torture
            chamber. Oh, a very delicate wit! I have tried it on
            many a prisoner, and there have been some who smiled.
            Now it is not easy to make a prisoner smile. And it
            should not be difficult to be a good jester, seeing
            that thou are one.</p>

  <h5 class="POINT">POINT</h5>  <br>  <p class="speech"> Difficult? Nothing easier. Nothing easier. Attend, and
            I will prove it to thee!

       No. 14. Oh! a private buffoon is a light-hearted loon
