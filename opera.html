           <p>  Night has spread her pall once more,
               And the pris'ner still is free:
          Open is his dungeon door,
               Useless now his dungeon key.
          He has shaken off his yoke—
               How, no mortal man can tell!
          Shame on loutish jailor-folk—
               Shame on sleepy sentinel!</p

 <p> Warders are ye?
     Whom do ye ward?
Warders are ye?
     Whom do ye ward?
Bolt, bar, and key,
     Shackle and cord,
Fetter and chain,

          volume</p>

    <p> [reads] "The Merrie Jestes of Hugh Ambrose, No.
     7863.The Poor Wit and the Rich Councillor. A certayne
     poor wit, being an-hungered, did meet a well-fed
     councillor.'Marry, fool,' quothe the councillor,
     'whither away?' 'In truth,' said the poor wag, 'in
     that I have eaten naught these two dayes, I do wither
     away, and that right rapidly!' The Councillor laughed
     hugely, and gave him a sausage." Humph! the councillor
     was easier to please than my new master the
     Lieutenant. I would like to take post under that
     councillor. Ah! 'tis but melancholy mumming when poor
     heart-broken, jilted Jack Point must needs turn to
     Hugh Ambrose for original light humour!

[Enter WILFRED, also in low spirits.</p>
